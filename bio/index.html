    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Steve Chab writes, designs, and codes music, art, and words in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania because Jesus loves you.</p>
    <p>Medium and genre do not limit Steve. His luscious musical compositions encompass elements of abstract electronic, boom bap hip hop, progressive rock, and post-hardcore. His poetry and lyrics challenge listeners through Biblical themes. He remixes art the same way that music concr√®te samples sound, manipulating patterns into glitchy, saturated spectacles. Critics have said he has a &quot;subtle obsession with specificity.&quot;</p>
    <p>For bands, rappers, and artists, Steve composes, produces, and engineers music, designs album artwork, and provides creative direction. He helps lead worship at Church gatherings and youth retreats. And for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), he designs websites and graphics with an eye for strategy and digital accessibility.</p>
    <p>Steve&#39;s musical collaborations have included <a href="https://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/album/vanillarabb">Vanilla</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/reclaimed">Sol Invicto</a> (featuring Stephen Carpenter of Deftones), <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/patterns-in-camo">Ali Spagnola</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvibKB3_Xpqg">Jake Bernsten</a> of Beauty Slap, and a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/potbot">robotic cooking pot</a>. He has shared the stage with The Composure, The Dudley Corporation, and Josh Epstein of JR JR. <a href="https://stevechab.bandcamp.com/">Four albums and six EPs</a> fill Steve&#39;s musical repertoire. In 2016, he <a href="https://stevechab.com/nils">reinterpreted Nils Frahm&#39;s neoclassical piano</a> as progressive rock by composing, performing, and recording new instrumentation atop three of Frahm&#39;s recorded pieces. Steve&#39;s 2013 album, Tempo, sets <a href="https://stevechab.bandcamp.com/album/tempo">spiritual poetry to a fury of dirty guitars</a>, polyrhythmic hip hop, and spectral, lo-fi melodies. It compares the truth of God&#39;s love for man with man&#39;s apathy towards the Creator.</p>
    <p>Steve and his wife, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElissaPaints">Elissa</a>, co-founded <a href="https://vibrantverse.org/">Vibrant Verse</a> in 2021, an organization that unites, trains, and showcases music artists and visual artists of faith who live in Pittsburgh. Steve also makes the internet pretty as <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/marcom/about/marketing/online-strategy.html%23sc">User Interface Designer and Front-end Developer</a> at CMU. He designs their website templates and serves on the Digital Strategy team. He created CMU&#39;s web design standards and co-leads workshops on design and digital accessibility. He also studied music technology, sound design, and creative writing at CMU. Before CMU, he studied multimedia at Pittsburgh Technical College where he now serves on their Web Design &amp; Development Advisory Board. He also serves on multiple ministry boards in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
    <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/">Steve&#39;s music on SoundCloud</a> has collected over 50,000 organic listens. In 2017, The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/583382c39f7456c31d7ef247/t/5c1150a688251bc78425bb99/1544638633049/volume42.pdf">Oakland Review</a> featured his art in Volume XLII. In 2014, he won Best Website Design in the Independent Artist Network for the Music Arts (IANMA) Awards. In 2011, Ramen Music Magazine featured an interview with him in issue five. In 2006, Detroit&#39;s Galactic Dust Records published his first album of electronic music.</p>
    <p>Steve lives in Pittsburgh with his wife, children, and Pit bull and wants you to know that Jesus loves you.</p>
