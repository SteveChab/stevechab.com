    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Steve Chab writes, designs, and codes music, art, and words in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania because Jesus loves you.</p>
    <p>Medium and genre do not limit Steve. His luscious musical compositions encompass elements of abstract electronic, boom bap hip hop, progressive rock, and post-hardcore. His poetry and lyrics challenge listeners with Biblical imagery. He remixes art the same way that music concr√®te samples sound, manipulating patterns into glitchy, saturated spectacles. Critics have said he has a &quot;subtle obsession with specificity.&quot;</p>
    <p>Steve performs in the greater Pittsburgh area acoustically and as a three-piece grunge/emo band called Steve Chab Band. For bands, rappers, and singers, he composes, produces, and engineers music, designs album artwork, and provides creative direction. He also performs with various musicians at Church gatherings, concerts, and youth retreats.</p>
    <p>Steve&#39;s musical collaborations have included <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://vanillabeats.bandcamp.com/album/vanillarabb">Vanilla<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a>, <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/reclaimed">Sol Invicto<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> (featuring Stephen Carpenter of Deftones), <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/patterns-in-camo">Ali Spagnola<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a>, <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvibKB3_Xpqg">Jake Bernsten<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> of Beauty Slap, and a <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/potbot">robotic cooking pot<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a>. He has shared the stage with The Composure, The Dudley Corporation, and Josh Epstein of JR JR. <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://stevechab.bandcamp.com/">Four albums and six EPs<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> fill Steve&#39;s musical repertoire. In 2016, he <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://stevechab.com/nils">reinterpreted Nils Frahm&#39;s neoclassical piano<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> as progressive rock by composing, performing, and recording new instrumentation atop three of Frahm&#39;s recorded pieces. Steve&#39;s 2013 album, Tempo, sets <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://stevechab.bandcamp.com/album/tempo">spiritual poetry to a fury of dirty guitars<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a>, polyrhythmic hip hop, and spectral, lo-fi melodies. It compares the truth of God&#39;s love for man with man&#39;s apathy towards the Creator.</p>
    <p>Steve and his wife, <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ElissaPaints">Elissa<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a>, co-founded <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://vibrantverse.org/">Vibrant Verse<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> in 2021, an organization that unites, trains, and showcases music artists and visual artists of faith who live in Pittsburgh. Steve also makes the internet pretty as a web developer, specializing in design, branding, and digital accessibility. He studied music technology, sound design, and creative writing at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Before CMU, he studied multimedia and graphic design at Pittsburgh Technical College and now helps plan curriculum for future students as part of their Web Design and Development Advisory Board. He also serves on multiple ministry boards in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
    <p><a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/stevechab/">Steve&#39;s music on SoundCloud<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> has collected tens of thousands of organic listens. In 2017, The <a class="link--external" target="_blank" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/583382c39f7456c31d7ef247/t/5c1150a688251bc78425bb99/1544638633049/volume42.pdf">Oakland Review<span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span></a> featured his art in Volume XLII. In 2014, he won Best Website Design in the Independent Artist Network for the Music Arts (IANMA) Awards. In 2011, Ramen Music Magazine featured an interview with him in issue five. In 2006, Detroit&#39;s Galactic Dust Records published his first electronic music album.</p>
    <p>Steve lives in Pittsburgh with his wife, children, and Pit bull and wants you to know that Jesus loves you.</p>
